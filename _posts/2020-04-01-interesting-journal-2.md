[A business that sells apps to count things.](https://countingthings.com). We
all need to count things at some point and this app can count logs, pipes,
layers, and other things. It is a beautiful example of doing one thing well and
providing value in a niche market. I love their simple and straight to the point
domain name.

Shipping containers and more specifically, the [intermodal freight
containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipping_container#Intermodal_freight_containers)
made the current scale of international trading possible. Earlier than that,
amphorae seem to have played the same role in the Roman empire. They were used
to ship wine, olive oil, and garum. They were produced at an industrial scale
and even displayed the brand of the manufacturer.

While visiting Lisbon, I was surprised when seeing for the first time an outdoor
lift. I was expecting Wikipedia to have a list of outdoor lifts but could not
find any.
