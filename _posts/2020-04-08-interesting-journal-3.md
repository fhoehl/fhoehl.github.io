Electric cars, scooters, and planes have been around for a very long time. They
seem novel, but they aren’t. We often overlook how great things take time and
imagine that it’s an overnight success. Reckless inventors, technological
progress, and time make things possible.

[This video from 1959 talks about an ~~electric~~
scooter.](https://www.ina.fr/video/AFE85008496)

[La Jamais Contente](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Jamais_Contente) is the
first car to reach 100 km/h in 1899. It also uses an electric motor!

[Colomban Cri-cri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colomban_Cri-cri) is the
smallest twin-engine aircraft in the world. An electric version is in the works.
When will we all have small green aeroplanes?

[Olms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olm) are fascinating aquatic salamanders
living in complete darkness.

Let’s talk about eco-computing. [Low-tech
Magazine](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com) is a low energy and low carbon
emission website. This economy is achieved by using solar energy, an
energy-efficient server, and optimising the content. For instance, images are
dithered and use a limited colour palette to save on bandwidth. It leads to a
surprisingly desirable aesthetic.

I also found a [Python
library](https://github.com/responsibleproblemsolving/energy-usage) that helps
you measure the energy usage of your code.

[Hyper Giant’s bio reactor](https://www.hypergiant.com/green/) is, in a
nutshell, a human-engineered tree. This reactor uses algae to capture C0₂.
