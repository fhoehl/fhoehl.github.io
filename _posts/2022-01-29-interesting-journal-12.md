Esoteric websites

I love websites whose purpose is to talk about one thing.

[LeapSecond.com](http://www.leapsecond.com) is all about "one man's quest for the most accurate clock". It's a great read about the history of cloys and time-keeping.

After clocks, plug sockets. The [Digital Museum of Plugs and Sockets](https://www.plugsocketmuseum.nl/Overview.html) catalogues a vast quantity of plugs, sockets and adapters. Personally I love the UK plug (although big, it feels secure and stays well in place) and hate the US one (too small and flimsy). Check out [this very unusual phased out design](https://www.plugsocketmuseum.nl/ContEUR_differentPins.html). This museum shows us that there were many iterations for something we take for granted.

[HiFi Archiv](http://www.hifi-archiv.info) is an impressive collection of vintage audio equipment leaflets and manuals. Strong vibes.

Some examples:

- [One Sony catalogue from the 90s](http://www.hifi-archiv.info/Sony/1986-1/)

- [Beautiful layouts from Braun catalogs](http://www.hifi-archiv.info/Braun%20HiFi%20Kataloge%20und%20Anleitungen/1972%20Braun%20Lautsprecher/index.html)

More catalogues. [Brickset](https://brickset.com/library/catalogues) features Lego catalogue from 1966 onwards. I love the simplicity of this [one](https://images.brickset.com/library/view/?f=catalogues/c68uk2).

Who doesn't love being in a forest? Hearing the little noises and the birds singing is relaxing. This [website](https://timberfestival.org.uk/soundsoftheforest-soundmap/) catalogues recordings from forests around the world. That's right, hear the sound of a forest in Japan without having to leave your seat!
