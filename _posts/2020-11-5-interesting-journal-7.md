**Synesthesia** describes the mechanism by which the stimulation of one sensory or cognitive system triggers the stimulation of another sensory or cognitive system. If you see different colours when looking at written numbers or letters, you are a synesthete. There are various types of synesthesia:

- Chromesthesia: associating sound with colours.
- Misophonia: sounds trigger reactions such as anger or fear. There is a [documentary](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/quietplease) on this condition.
