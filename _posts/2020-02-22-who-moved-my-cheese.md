title: "Book: Who Moved My Cheese?"
---

Who Moved My Cheese is a cute short story about change. This book will not only make you hungry but also teach you a life lesson. Do you anticipate change? How do you react to change? Are you complacent? Exploring new paths require efforts, but it’s rewarding, life-changing and sometimes necessary for survival.

> “Movement in a new direction helps you find new cheese”

Sometimes you are in an *exploit* situation: everything is fine, you can rest and enjoy life. Sometimes you are in a *explore* situation: it’s time to go out and try new things that transform your life. Enjoy your current situation as it is. Transitioning from one to the other is hard, but you can approach it with preparation and lightness.
