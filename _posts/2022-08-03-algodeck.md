This year, I've been busy writing things on [Algodeck](https://algodeck.com)!

* Exploring Stoicism and how it can help you become a better engineer
  * [Part 1](https://algodeck.com/stoic-developer-1/)
  * [Part 2](https://algodeck.com/stoic-developer-2/)
  * [Part 3](https://algodeck.com/stoic-developer-3/)
* [Finding the best word to start a game of
  Wordle](https://algodeck.com/wordle-first-move/)
* [Creating a list of steps to approach a
  problem](https://algodeck.com/how-to-approach-a-problem/)
* [Studying lossless compression, Huffman coding and Shannon's
  entropy](https://algodeck.com/lossless-compression/)

I enjoy a lot using my own photos for each article. I'm keeping potential
pictures in a folder, and it feels gratifying the day I have a good match.
