Wikipedia has some of the finest lists out there. Here are some of my
favourites:

[Let’s start with the list of mathematical symbols by introduction
date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_mathematical_symbols_by_introduction_date).

[List of oldest
companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_companies). How come
most of the ones founded before 1300 are from Japan?

It’s fascinating to think that symbols taken for granted had to be created at
some point.

Next, a [list of topics characterised as
pseudoscience](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_topics_characterized_as_pseudoscience).

What about food?

[The list of fermented
foods](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fermented_foods).

[The list of chocolate
bars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chocolate_bar_brands).

[The list of steamed
foods](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_steamed_foods).

I could not end this note without going meta. Of course, there is [a Wikipedia
list of lists of lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lists_of_lists).
