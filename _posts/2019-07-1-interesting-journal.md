Veneer made with corn husk by [Fernando Laposse](https://www.fernandolaposse.com/). A beautiful material that is helping a Mexican village and help to preserve biodiversity. Plating corn with black beans and pumpkins creates a system that requires no fertiliser and keep the soil fertile. Everything can be use on a corn: the hob can become charcoal, the leaves can be used to wrap food… One of the big challenge is the way the world is organised around transport and pricing of food: it’s hard to sell native species at a good price.

[Notpla](https://www.notpla.com/products/): an edible and biodegradable material combining seaweed and plants. I ate a small pouch containing an elderflower cordial. The material has no taste.

The power of suggestion and priming influence so much of our decisions and behaviour.

[I Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching): this ancient Chinese book introduce the concept of zero “nothingness” and one “oneness” as a universal way to describe things. This inspired [Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz).
