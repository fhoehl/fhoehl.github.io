## Interesting apps for remote work

Share location and presence between friend and colleagues with [There](https://there.pm/). It’s a nifty macOS tray app.

[Sococo](https://www.sococo.com/) is similar but adds a virtual office plan map. Showing your colleagues as avatars on a 2D map add more life.

Join meeting with super-powers. Please tell me when, where, and I will be there. [Meeter](https://trymeeter.com/) solves the problem of finding out where you should sign in to join your next meeting.

[Hand mirror](https://handmirror.app/) is a cute little app that will show you how you look from your webcam.

[Tyke](https://tyke.app/) is a minimal note-taking app. Perfect for taking note during the meeting.

The quality of the video from the most webcam is terrible. iPhone’s have a great camera. Why not use it as a webcam with [Camo](https://reincubate.com/camo/)?
