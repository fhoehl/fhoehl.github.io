## Writing

I wanted to focus on writing this year, which worked well for me.  One of the
key factors was to block thirty minutes every morning just after waking up to
write (or stare at a blank page).  The second thing that worked for me was to
release articles and essays every two-week and commit to a publishing date in
advance.  The first week is finding references, researching, and just putting
words on a page.  The following week would be mostly editing.

Things I wrote :

* I thought about our relationship with objects in [Material attachments or sticky objects](https://fhoehl.com/2022/10/01/material-attachments.html).
* [On Japanese tools](https://fhoehl.com/2022/10/27/on-japanese-tools.html) list some of my favourite tools and what makes them attractive.
* I studied Stoicism and transformed my notes into a series of useful tips for developers :
	* [Being a pessimist is not such a bad thing](https://algodeck.com/stoic-developer-1/)
	* [No bugs & problems; you might be doing your job wrong](https://algodeck.com/stoic-developer-2/)
	* [How to debug oneself](https://algodeck.com/stoic-developer-3/)
* [How to approach a coding problem](https://algodeck.com/how-to-approach-a-problem/) list some common starting points to solving a problem.
* I wrote an article explaining how data compression works. [Data compression and the meaning of Life](https://algodeck.com/lossless-compression/).
* I played a bit too much Wordle . [What is the best word to start a game of Wordle](https://algodeck.com/wordle-first-move/)?
* [Esoteric websites or websites doing one thing well](https://fhoehl.com/2022/01/29/interesting-journal-12.html)
* [An essay on types and categories](https://fhoehl.com/2022/08/27/types-and-categories.html)
* I cleaned my bookshelf and wrote about some strategies for tidying bookshelves. [You probably won’t read those books](https://fhoehl.com/2022/09/08/books.html).

# Things I’ve been working on

## Algodeck

I’ve been continuing to work on the illustration for my upcoming deck of cards
on computer science.  This project took a  very long time, but I hope 2023 will
be the year I will finish it.  I’ve been happy that my graphic design skill has
developed and refined with this project.

## Eye

A self-contained HTML poem on focus and impermanence :
[Eye](https://fhoehl.com/eye.html).  Last year I made [The
Chair](https://fhoehl.com/chair.html).  I love a single HTML page that includes
everything to render something on the screen.  It’s a mixed media.  You add CSS,
images, JavaScript, and SVG like a collage and can create anything.

# Things I learned

## IPFS

I worked on [w3name](https://web3.storage/products/w3name/) and
[w3.storage](https://web3.storage).  They are developers’ tools for adding and
managing file upload to [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/), a distributed file storage
network where files are unique, and content is addressed.  NFTs are generally
uploaded to IPFS.  Working on those projects was an excellent introduction to
IPFS.  Working with immutable and content-addressed files makes developing an
application for users quite challenging. And it is most of the time hard to see
the benefit of using IPFS over any other cloud storage like S3.  I see a big
potential for public data (e.g. museum collection, research data) and things
like NFTs.

## Cloudflare workers and durable objects

While working on w3.storage, I had the opportunity to learn about Cloudflare
workers and durable objects.  They are both exciting technologies, and I will
consider them for other projects.

## Notebook and solander box making

I learned how to make notebooks and boxes with the London Centre from Book Arts.
That was a delightful activity away from computers.
I’m now using the box to store old notebooks.

I’m planning on creating a new box for index cards.

## Blender

I didn’t use Blender for a very long time.
I started using it when it still fitted on a floppy disk !
I missed using it daily.
This year, a perfect occasion arose to dust off my 3D modelling skills : a house renovation.
I could model the house from the floor plan, which helped me make decisions on space and layout.

I also made a bonus GIF to play with the physic engine :

I hope to make Blender an integral tool in my work.  I want to learn how to use
the new [Geometry
Nodes](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/3.4/modeling/geometry_nodes/introduction.html).

# Travels

With the pandemic, it felt like a very long time since I went on a long holiday.
I had the excuse to travel for two weddings this year !  One in Poland and the
other in Mauritius.
