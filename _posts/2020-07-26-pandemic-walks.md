title: Pandemic walks
---

With London's pandemic lockdown, I have more time to walk in my neighbourhood
parks. I usually go for one walk after lunch to get some fresh air and another
stroll at the end of the day to disconnect from remote work. Seeing the plants
and trees every day has become a treat. I have a fond memory of the cherry
blossom or the aroma of the flowering linden and wisteria. Right now, my
favourite spot is under a fig tree. If you are lucky, you will catch the
delicate aroma produced by the leaves. These spectacles are short and disappear
within days or weeks. Checking up on nature has become a favourite recreation.
You can hear me say: "Today let's go and check the sunflowers; they must be
ready.".
