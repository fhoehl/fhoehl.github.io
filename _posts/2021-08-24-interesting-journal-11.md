Learning new words and creating a new one.

[Weasel word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word): a  part of a sentence
that creates a sense of false authority or importance. Once you know about
weasel words, you will see them everywhere. Knowing how to spot them helps to
debunk misinformation and write better.

Examples:

> Clearly…

> …it’s commonsense…

> Award-winning…

> Up to eighty per cent…

[Shibboleth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth): an arcane word, phrase
or custom that can help distinguish one group of people from another. Similar to
a password, it signals that you are part of a club.

The word *folktale* describes a story passed down from one generation to another.

I propose the creation of the word: *folkfact*.

A *folkfact* is a fact that is passed down from one generation to another. The
truth of a *folkfact* is not discussed, and the origin is not clearly known.

Examples:

> Rusty objects cause tetanus

> Mongol warriors called Tartars invented the steak tartare. They used to place
> a steak under their saddle to tenderize it before eating it raw.

*Folkfacts* are similar to common misconceptions, of which Wikipedia provides an
extensive [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions).
